## Installation
Python and Flask

First, make sure you install a copy of Python. For this course, you should be using Python version 3.6 or higher.
You’ll also need to install pip. If you downloaded Python from Python’s website, you likely already have pip installed (you can check by running pip in a terminal window). If you don’t have it installed, be sure to install it before moving on!

To try running your first Flask application

Download the project1 distribution directory by cloning https://github.com/leonardo185/Project-2.git.
In a terminal window, navigate into your project directory.
Run pip3 install -r requirements.txt in your terminal window to make sure that all of the necessary Python packages (Flask and SQLAlchemy, for instance) are installed.
Set the environment variable FLASK_APP to be application.py. On a Mac or on Linux, the command to do this is export FLASK_APP=application.py. On Windows, the command is instead set FLASK_APP=application.py. You may optionally want to set the environment variable FLASK_DEBUG to 1, which will activate Flask’s debugger and will automatically reload your web application whenever you save a change to a file.
Set the environment variable DATABASE_URL to be the URI of your database, which you should be able to see from the credentials page on Heroku.
Run flask run to start up your Flask application.
